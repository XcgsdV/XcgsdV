## Hey y'all!

I'm currently an undergraduate student at Arkansas Tech University. I'm majoring Phyiscs and Vocal Music, but I try to study just about everything I find interesting! That includes mathematics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, regular chemistry, optimal Pokemon team design, and really anything cool that I can find time to devote to.
I'm using GitHub primarily for version control of some personal projects and documents.
